### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is ZeitounMax and I'm 33 years old. I'm currently in training to become a web developer. I'm studying at the Wild Code School, where I'm learning HTML, CSS, JS, React, Express, and SQL.

- **WildOut**: WildOut is a project realized within the framework of the Wild Code School Project 2. You don't know what to do today? What if you look at the events in your city taking into account the weather? That's where WildOut comes in. Thanks to our APIs and a bit of logic, we were able to set up a system so that WildOut shows you the right events based on the weather.
